## Current Features Status

### âœ… Completed (Day 1-3 Sprint)

- User authentication (mock implementation)
- Listing creation with photos and location
- Browse and search listings
- Interactive maps with markers
- Booking inquiry system
- Navigation and basic UI polish
- Form validation and error handling

### ðŸš§ In Progress / Next Steps

- Real backend integration (Firebase/Supabase)
- In-app messaging system
- Payment processing
- Push notifications
- Reviews and ratings system
- Advanced search filters

## Key Technical Decisions

### State Management - Zustand

Chose Zustand over Redux for its simplicity and smaller bundle size. Perfect for rapid prototyping while maintaining scalability.

### Navigation - React Navigation 6

Used bottom tabs for main navigation with stack navigation for detail screens. Provides native feel and smooth transitions.

### Maps - React Native Maps

Integrated native maps for location selection and viewing. Essential for a location-based marketplace.

### Forms - React Hook Form

Chosen for performance and developer experience. Minimal re-renders and excellent TypeScript support.

### Mock Data Strategy

Implemented comprehensive mock data to demonstrate functionality without backend dependency. Easy to replace with real API calls.

## Scaling Considerations

### Backend Integration

- Replace mock stores with real API calls
- Implement proper authentication (JWT tokens)
- Add image upload to cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary)
- Implement real-time messaging (WebSocket/Firebase)

### Performance Optimizations

- Implement lazy loading for listing images
- Add infinite scroll for listing feeds
- Cache location data and search results
- Optimize map rendering for large datasets

### Enhanced Features

- Advanced search (radius, amenities, availability calendar)
- Payment processing (Stripe integration)
- Review and rating system
- Push notifications for bookings
- In-app messaging with photo sharing

## Development Notes

### Code Organization

- Separated concerns with dedicated stores for auth and listings
- Reusable components and consistent styling
- TypeScript for better development experience
- Proper error handling and loading states

### UI/UX Decisions

- Familiar patterns from popular marketplace apps
- Consistent color scheme and spacing
- Accessible design with proper contrast
- Native platform conventions for navigation

This project demonstrates a solid foundation for a storage marketplace app with room for extensive feature expansion and backend integration.
